<p>
I am Shuo Xie (解说), a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.ttic.edu/">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu/">Zhiyuan Li</a>.
I am currently working on deep learning theory and optimization. <br>
Previously, I received a B.S. degree in statistics from Peking University and a M.S. degree in statistics from University of Chicago and did research in natural language processing with <a href="https://www.hongyuanmei.com/">Hongyuan Mei</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/">Hao Tan.

<p>
During my undergraduate time, I was member of the Peking University Softball Team  and our team won the championship of the Beijing University softball tournament twice.<br>
I was also the captain of the Softball Team of School of Mathematical Sciences. 
Here are some photos when I play softball. <a href="softball_1.jpg">A swing</a> <a href="softball_2.jpg">Last day at PKU</a> <br> 
    In my spare time, I also enjoy hiking, climbing, cycling and I am always happy to try new kinds of sports. <br>
