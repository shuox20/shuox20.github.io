<p>
I am Shuo Xie (解说), a second-year Master student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.hongyuanmei.com/">Hongyuan Mei</a>.
I also collaborate with Prof. <a href="https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu">Qing Qu</a> (UMich) and <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~airsplay/">Hao Tan</a> (Adobe Research). <br>
I am interested in developing technically principled methods for solving challenging real-world problems. I am currently doing research at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. <br>
Before joining UChicago, I received a B.S. degree in statistics from Peking University.
